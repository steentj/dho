# Stage 10 Completion Report: Admin Endpoints & Config Integration

Date: 2025-09-03
Branch: `stage10-config-endpoints`

## Objectives
1. Introduce central admin configuration (enable flag, token, view permissions).
2. Add secure introspection endpoint (`GET /configz`) with secret masking.
3. Add runtime configuration refresh endpoint (`POST /admin/refresh-config`).
4. Improve embedding provider initialization for future full config integration.
5. Provide tests covering authorization matrix and refresh semantics.
6. Maintain or improve overall test pass rate and coverage.

## Summary of Changes
- Extended `config/config_loader.py` with `AdminConfig` dataclass and updated `AppConfig`.
- Added helper auth utilities (`_admin_enabled`, `_admin_token`, `_admin_allow_view`, `_require_admin`).
- Implemented `/configz` and `/admin/refresh-config` endpoints in `soegemaskine/searchapi/dhosearch.py`.
- Masked secrets (`database.password`, `provider.openai_api_key`) via `AppConfig.to_safe_dict()`.
- Adjusted provider constructors to accept explicit parameters (forward-compatible design).
- Added dedicated test module: `soegemaskine/tests/unit/searchapi/test_admin_config_endpoints.py`.
- Updated operations documentation with new endpoints and environment variables.

## Test & Quality Results
- Full test suite: 604 passed, 13 skipped, 5 xfailed (expected), 1 xpassed.
- Coverage: 91.63% (threshold 80%).
- New endpoint tests validate:
  - 404 when admin disabled.
  - 401 when enabled but unauthorized.
  - 200 success with masked secrets when authorized.
  - Runtime refresh updates `DISTANCE_THRESHOLD`.

## Security Considerations
- 404 when admin disabled hides endpoint presence.
- Accepts either `x-admin-token` or `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
- Secrets always masked in introspection output.
- No token logging or echoing.

## Notable Implementation Details
- Tests import module namespace and update `dhosearch._cfg` to avoid stale global state.
- Refresh endpoint recalculates embedding runtime parameters to keep provider behavior aligned with updated config.

## Limitations / Deferred Work
- Provider factory still performs partial env fallback; full config-driven factory integration pending (will be addressed now per follow-up request).
- No rate limiting or audit logging on admin endpoints (could add minimal structured logs with correlation IDs later).
- Token rotation mechanism not implemented; relies on static env variable.

## Next Suggested Steps
1. Implement config-driven provider factory method (create_from_config) and update `dhosearch` lifespan (IN PROGRESS after this report creation).
2. Add test coverage for Bearer auth variant.
3. Add lightweight audit log for admin actions.
4. Consider optional feature flag to disable `/configz` independently of refresh endpoint.

## Acceptance Criteria Mapping
| Criterion | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Admin config dataclass added | Done |
| /configz endpoint with masking | Done |
| /admin/refresh-config endpoint | Done |
| Tests for 404/401/200 & refresh | Done |
| Documentation updated | Done |
| Coverage >= 80% | Achieved (91.63%) |

## Conclusion
Stage 10 goals have been met: secure, masked configuration introspection and dynamic runtime refresh are implemented with solid test coverage and no regressions.

### Addendum: Config-Driven Provider Factory (Post-Report Enhancement)
After initial completion, `EmbeddingProviderFactory.create_from_config(cfg)` was added and `dhosearch.lifespan` now uses it. Tests updated to mock `create_from_config` instead of `create_provider`. Backward-compatible path retained via internal delegation. Coverage remains above threshold (>=90%).
