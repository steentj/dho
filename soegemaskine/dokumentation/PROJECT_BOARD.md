## In Progress

- None

## Done

- [x] **[5] Create Simple Test GUI for API Testing** ✅ **COMPLETED**
  - **Modern Streamlit-based GUI created and fully functional**
  - **Key features implemented:**
    - ✅ Danish-localized modern interface with clean design
    - ✅ Proper nginx endpoint integration (localhost:8080)
    - ✅ Correct API request/response format handling
    - ✅ Grouped results display with concatenated chunks
    - ✅ Dual URL support (user-facing + internal with page numbers)
    - ✅ Advanced result formatting with metadata
    - ✅ Clickable links opening in default browser
    - ✅ Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
    - ✅ Cross-platform compatibility (macOS, Linux, Windows)
  - **Technical specifications:**
    - ✅ Created in `api_testgui/` folder
    - ✅ Streamlit framework for web-based GUI
  - ✅ Updated til nginx endpointet fra docker-compose.edge.yml
    - ✅ Handles SearchResult format from dhosearch.py
    - ✅ Professional error handling for API connectivity
    - ✅ Support for updated response format with grouped results
  - **Documentation and packaging:**
    - ✅ Comprehensive Danish README.md with installation/usage
    - ✅ Updated requirements.txt with version specifications
    - ✅ Linux build script for executable distribution
    - ✅ Troubleshooting guide and platform support info

- [x] **[1] Update Search Response URLs (remove page number in user-facing links)** ✅ **COMPLETED**
  - **All 4 phases implemented successfully**
  - **21 comprehensive unit tests created and passing**
  - **Key features implemented:**
    - ✅ Distance threshold filtering (DISTANCE_THRESHOLD=0.5)
    - ✅ Result grouping by book (multiple chunks per book)
    - ✅ Dual URL structure (user-facing + internal with page numbers)
    - ✅ Chunk concatenation with clear separators
    - ✅ Updated API response structure
    - ✅ Environment variable configuration
  - **TDD approach:** Tests written first, implementation follows
  - **Backwards compatibility:** Maintained existing API structure where possible

- [x] **[3] Create unit and integration tests** ✅ **COMPLETED**
  - **95 tests implemented and passing**
  - **59% code coverage achieved**
  - **Comprehensive testing infrastructure created**
  - **All 5 phases completed:**
    - ✅ Phase 1: Foundation Setup (pytest, fixtures, CI/CD)
    - ✅ Phase 2: Unit Tests (56 tests for individual components)
    - ✅ Phase 3: Integration Tests (27 tests for workflows)
    - ✅ Phase 4: Test Utilities (12 validation tests)
    - ✅ Phase 5: Documentation and CI (complete guide)
  - **Features:** Mock services, async testing, error scenarios, local Mac testing
  - **Quality:** Zero test failures, fast execution, professional-grade infrastructure
