# Stage 9 Completion Report: Central Configuration Unification

**Creation date/time:** 2025-09-03,  (auto-generated)
**Last Modified date/time:** 2025-09-03

## Overview
Stage 9 introduced a centralized, typed configuration system to replace scattered `os.getenv` calls, improving maintainability, testability, and operational clarity. The refactor focused deliberately on the search API (`dhosearch.py`) as the first integration point to minimize risk while proving the pattern. Supporting tests and documentation were added to ensure stability and future extensibility.

## Completed Changes

### 1. Central Configuration Module
- Added `config/config_loader.py` containing `AppConfig` and nested dataclasses.
- Implemented `get_config()` (singleton), `refresh_config()` (explicit reload), and `to_safe_dict()` (secret masking).
- Performed provider validation (`PROVIDER` must be one of: `openai`, `ollama`, `dummy`).
- Normalized numeric parsing (timeouts, retries, distance threshold, chunk size).

### 2. Search API Refactor (`dhosearch.py`)
- Replaced direct environment reads with `_cfg = get_config()`.
- Injected configuration at lifespan startup via `refresh_config()`.
- Unified embedding retry/timeout values drawn from `cfg.embedding`.
- Applied provider + model selection using centralized config.
- Introduced backward-compatible distance threshold override logic honoring runtime `DISTANCE_THRESHOLD` env changes used in existing tests.

### 3. Test Additions
- Added `tests/test_config_loader.py` covering:
  - Default values and sane fallbacks.
  - Provider validation error path.
  - Distance threshold parsing (valid + invalid fallback).
  - Singleton caching + refresh semantics.
  - Secret masking for `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` and `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
- Adjusted no existing tests—compatibility preserved (notably those patching `os.getenv`).

### 4. Documentation Updates
- Updated `documentation/TEKNISK/OPERATIONS_ENVIRONMENTS.md` with a new section: *Central Konfiguration (Stage 9)*.
- Documented structure, usage, masking, migration strategy, and future expansion.

### 5. Quality & Stability
- Full test suite: 594 passed / 13 skipped / 5 xfailed / 1 xpassed — no regressions.
- Coverage remains >91% (threshold >80%).
- No lint or syntax errors introduced.

## Architecture Benefits
| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Config Access | Ad-hoc `os.getenv` scattered | Central typed object (`AppConfig`) |
| Validation | Implicit & inconsistent | Early validation (provider, numeric parsing) |
| Testability | Hard to inject overrides | Direct `load_config({...})` in tests |
| Security Masking | Manual / inconsistent | Standardized via `to_safe_dict()` |
| Future Reload | Not structured | `refresh_config()` primitive in place |

## Backward Compatibility
- Retained `os` module import in `dhosearch.py` because legacy tests patch `soegemaskine.searchapi.dhosearch.os.getenv`.
- Added in-function override for `DISTANCE_THRESHOLD` so tests manipulating env at runtime continue to work without rewriting fixtures.
- Health & readiness endpoints unchanged externally.

## Known Limitations / Deferred Work
| Item | Current Status | Planned Action |
|------|----------------|----------------|
| Providers still read env directly | Not yet migrated | Refactor providers to use config in a later stage |
| Dynamic live reload | Manual via code only | Add secure admin endpoint (e.g. `/admin/refresh-config`) |
| Enum validation | Basic string assertions | Consider Pydantic or `Enum` types for strictness |
| Config introspection endpoint | Not present | Add masked `/configz` endpoint |
| Distance threshold patching | Dual path (env override + config) | Simplify after test migration |

## Risk Mitigation
- Scope limited to one API module.
- Comprehensive unit + integration test run after each change cluster.
- Backward-compatible bridging logic ensures zero test rewrites.

## Test Evidence (Extract)
```
TOTAL: 594 passed, 13 skipped, 5 xfailed, 1 xpassed
Coverage: 91.69%
```

## Files Added / Modified (Summary)
- Added: `config/config_loader.py` (core feature)
- Added: `tests/test_config_loader.py` (validation & safety)
- Modified: `soegemaskine/searchapi/dhosearch.py` (config adoption + compat logic)
- Modified: `documentation/TEKNISK/OPERATIONS_ENVIRONMENTS.md` (new section)

## Validation Checklist
| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Central module loads without side effects | ✅ |
| Singleton behaves predictably | ✅ |
| Provider validation fails fast | ✅ |
| Distance threshold tolerant of bad input | ✅ |
| Search API uses unified config | ✅ |
| Existing tests remain green | ✅ |
| Docs updated for operators | ✅ |

## Migration Strategy (Future)
1. Refactor embedding providers to consume `get_config()` (remove env duplication).
2. Add secure config refresh + introspection endpoints.
3. Replace runtime env patching in tests with fixture-driven config injection.
4. Introduce stricter validation (Enums / Pydantic hybrid) + schema docs.
5. Explore caching / TTL-based soft refresh for selected parameters (e.g. thresholds).

## Recommendation
Proceed to a focused “Stage 10” targeting provider adoption + dynamic config refresh, keeping incremental, test-backed scope.

## Status
**Stage 9: COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY ✅**
