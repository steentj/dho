# Semantic Search Prototype: Improvement Project Board

## To Do

- [ ] [2] Streamline Adding Books to Vector Database
- [ ] [4] A/B Test: Book Title in Embeddings

## In Progress

- None

## Done

- [x] **[1] Update Search Response URLs (remove page number in user-facing links)** ✅ **COMPLETED**
  - **All 4 phases implemented successfully**
  - **21 comprehensive unit tests created and passing**
  - **Key features implemented:**
    - ✅ Distance threshold filtering (DISTANCE_THRESHOLD=0.5)
    - ✅ Result grouping by book (multiple chunks per book)
    - ✅ Dual URL structure (user-facing + internal with page numbers)
    - ✅ Chunk concatenation with clear separators
    - ✅ Updated API response structure
    - ✅ Environment variable configuration
  - **TDD approach:** Tests written first, implementation follows
  - **Backwards compatibility:** Maintained existing API structure where possible

- [x] **[3] Create unit and integration tests** ✅ **COMPLETED**
  - **95 tests implemented and passing**
  - **59% code coverage achieved**
  - **Comprehensive testing infrastructure created**
  - **All 5 phases completed:**
    - ✅ Phase 1: Foundation Setup (pytest, fixtures, CI/CD)
    - ✅ Phase 2: Unit Tests (56 tests for individual components)
    - ✅ Phase 3: Integration Tests (27 tests for workflows)
    - ✅ Phase 4: Test Utilities (12 validation tests)
    - ✅ Phase 5: Documentation and CI (complete guide)
  - **Features:** Mock services, async testing, error scenarios, local Mac testing
  - **Quality:** Zero test failures, fast execution, professional-grade infrastructure
